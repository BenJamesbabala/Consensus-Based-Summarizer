# Automatic-Text-Summarizer
## Author- Ayush Pareek
This is an implementation of "Automatic Consensus-Based Text Summarizer" along with text-organizing capabilities that can generate genre-specific, generic or user-configured  summaries of a large amount of unorganized text. We are currently using a number of independent text-mining algorithms based on different statistical models to compute the summaries and combining them using configurable consensus techniques.
